Please note: This is a fork of [MSGARCH package](https://github.com/keblu/MSGARCH)
This fork includes time-varying transition probabilities for the methods like `FitML()` and 
`CreateSpec()`. This fork was created for the purpose of my master thesis. I do not take any responsibility for the functionality of the package and advise anyone to use this fork 
at your own risk.
